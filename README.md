# Digital-modulation-projects.
-P1.digital_modulation_qam:
Python project for designing and implementing a complete QAM modem. It includes symbol mapping, Gray coding, IQ constellation (TX/RX), energy and phase analysis, BER/SNR evaluation, and image transmission over noisy channels.
-P2. NETSPOT (WI-FI):
Wi-Fi network analysis and optimization project using NetSpot. Includes site inspection, signal mapping, interference detection, channel planning, and deployment optimization based on QAM/PSK modulation principles.
